# simple-images-to-pdf-for-kindle
Manga pages are usually too large to use on my old kindle. This script compresses them so they will fit and be more manageble by reducing resolution, doing jpg compression and making it black and white.  

The script has input support for:  .png and .jpg
The script has output support for: .pdf and .cbz
