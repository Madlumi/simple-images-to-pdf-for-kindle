# simple-images-to-pdf-for-kindle
Not well polished, just did what i needed it to at the time.

Manga pages are usually too large to use on my old kindle. This script compresses them so they will fit and be more manageble by reducing resolution, doing jpg compression and making it black and white. (might need some editing in main for correct output)

The script has input support for:  .png and .jpg

The script has output support for: .pdf and .cbz
